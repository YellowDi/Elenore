Elenore is a modern CSS framework based on [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes).

## Quick install

Elenore is constantly in development! Try it out now:

### NPM

```sh
npm install elenore
```
**or**

### Bower

```sh
bower install elenore
```

## CSS only

Elenore is a **CSS** framework. As such, the sole output is a single CSS file: [Elenore.css](https://github.com/YellowDi/Elenore/blob/master/css/Elenore.css)

You can either use that file, "out of the box", or download the Sass source files to customize the variables

There is **no** JavaScript included. People generally want to use their own JS implementation (and usually already have one). Elenore can be considered "environment agnostic": it's just the style layer on top of the logic.

## Browser Support

Elenore uses [autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to make (most) Flexbox features compatible with earlier browser versions. According to [Can I use](http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox), Elenore is compatible with:

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Opera
* Safari

Internet Explorer (10+) is only partially supported.
